# xMatters REST API's for Postman

This repository provides you with a Postman collection that contains all xMatters Rest API end points as of October 30 / 2020. It also includes Postman Runners that allow you to chain API requests together to do cool things.

- 385 xMatters API requests.
- JavaScript and JSON payloads for each API.
- Runner Collections to automate processes that require multiple API request.
- Build your own custom Runners to string together multiple API requests.
- Automatically adds Postman environment variables with returned results from API requests. This allows you to chain multiple API's together without needing to manually move UUID's from one request to the next.
- Make multiple API requests using postman Runners to import large datasets into xMatters from a csv files.
- Use the xMatters API without being an API expert.

Depending on what API's you intend to use, not all values above are required. For best results I suggest populating all values.

## xMatters Setup

Create an xMatters user that can authenticate using REST API.
(https://help.xmatters.com/xmAPI/#authentication)

# How it works

Provided in this Postman collection are all xMatters API's available as of May 3 / 2018. It also includes Postman Runners that allow you to chain API requests together to do cool things.

To use this, update the collection variables as explained above to your specific use case. Once the variables are set, all APIs will work together.

Each API call made in postman will save an environment variable related to the API just used. This will allow you to make subsequent API calls that use the results of the previous API.

This means you can do things like the following:

| API                                   | Collection Variable Used                        | Environment Variable used  | Environment Variable Created |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 1. Create a new Site                  | siteID                                          |                            | siteUUID                     |
| 2. Create a new Person Supervisor     | supervisorID                                    | siteUUID                   | supervisorUUID               |
| 3. Create a new User                  | personID                                        | siteUUID, supervisorUUID   | personUUID                   |
| 4. Modify a User                      | personID,profilePropertName,profilePropertValue | personUUID, supervisorUUID | personUUID                   |
| 5. Add device to user (from step 3)   |                                                 | personUUID                 | deviceUUID                   |
| 6. Create a new Group                 | groupID                                         |                            | groupUUID                    |
| 7. Create new shift (Group from 5)    | groupID                                         |                            | shiftID, shiftUUID           |
| 8. Add member to shift (Shift from 6) | groupID                                         |                            |                              |
| 9. Add member to shift (Shift from 6) | groupID                                         |                            |                              |
| 10. Create a new Group                | groupID                                         |                            | groupUUID                    |

- All API Call are available is JavaScript and JSON format.

## JavaScript Format

JavaScript format uses Postman Pre-Request Scripts to build a json object and save it into a Postman environment variable {{data}}. This gets posted as raw body in application/json format.

The JavaScript formatted request allow you to add your own code and customize the API as required.

The last couple lines of Postman Pre-Request Scripts use Postman functions to set environment variables and log the payload that is used in the post body.

_Example:_

```
// Set Postman environment variable named data.
pm.environment.set("data", JSON.stringify(data));

// Log the data json object so you can easily copy the format.
// Access Postman logs from *View -> Show Postman Console.*
console.log("Data",JSON.strinify(data))
```

Many of the API's will also use Postman Tests to save part of the response into an environment variable for easy API chaining. Typically this will save the UUID.

_Example:_

```
let jsonData = JSON.parse(responseBody);

tests['Get Device Successfull: ' + jsonData.id];
postman.setEnvironmentVariable('deviceUUID', jsonData.id);
```

## Json Format

JSON formatted request are provided in raw body application/json format and do not allow any JavaScript. If you want to customize this format you will need to change the json body directly. No JavaScript logic can be used for this format.

## Runners

Runners are groups of API calls that will run one after another. You can use these to create a site, create a user, and then add a user device all in one action.

Several Runners have been included that are ready to use:

- Create User with Devices
- Create Group with Shifts and Members

- Create Groups from a Data File
- Create Shifts from Data File
- Add Members to Shift from Data File
- Add member to group roster from Data File

- Create Groups From xMatters Group Export using Data File
- Import Sites from Data File

## Runner General Use Instructions

You can access Runners by Clicking the **Runner** button in top left corner of Postman.
[Runner Help](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/collection_runs/starting_a_collection_run)

Some runners require a csv data file. Postman will run through the API's in the selected runner once for each row of provided data.

This allows you to import a list of groups, add members to a group or import sites from postman.

Postman will process each row of data provided and use each column as variables for the API.

You can easily create your own runners along with your own custom data.

## Runner Explanations:

### Create User with Devices

This runner will create a user along with devices from Collection Variables. It does not use a csv data file.

**Steps:**

- _Get a Site_ (Gets the UUID of the site specified in the API call that a person will be added to.)
- _Create a person Supervisor_ (Creates a person supervisor. This user will be the supervisor for the person created in the next step.)
- _Create a person_ (Creates a person.)
- _Create a device_ (Adds a device to the person created in the last step. Add additional Create device API calls to add more than one device and specify sequence and delays between then.)

### Create Group with Shifts and Members

This runner will create a group, shifts and members from Collection Variables.

**Steps:**

- Create a person Supervisor
- Create a person
- Create a group
- Create a shift (recurring)
- Create a shift (24x7)
- Add a member to a shift (Peer)
- Add a member to a shift (Management)

### The Next 4 Runners are designed to use together one after another:

Before using these runners please ensure users have been added to xMatters. If users do not exist these will fail.

1.  Create Groups from Data file
2.  Add Shifts from Data File

    - Add Members to Shift from Data File

          _Add members to Shift (Above) OR Add Members to Roster (Below) depending on what you want to do._

    - Add Members to Group Roster from Data File

### Create Groups from Data file

This runner will Add Multiple Groups from a csv data file.

**Data File Format**: [Create Groups](postman-Groups.csv)

The following data format would create 3 new groups in xMatters and set a specific user supervisor to each group.

| Group Name     | Group Description              | supervisorUUID                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| DBA Team       | A Team for opening new tickets | 374551cb-76f9-41c7-bffc-723d9b6b6e34 |
| Network Admin  | A team of slackers             | 374551cb-76f9-41c7-bffc-723d9b6b6e34 |
| CCV Daily Sync |                                | 374551cb-76f9-41c7-bffc-723d9b6b6e34 |

### Add Shifts from Data File

- This runner will Add shifts to Groups from a data file.
- This runner is best used after the _Create Groups from Data File_ runner above.
- This runner can be used to add all the shifts to the groups added in the previous runner.
- Groups must already exist in xMatters.
- This is a complicated data file and the headings will mean very little to you without reading xMatters API Document on Shift Object.
- Not all columns are needed for each type of shift.
- The sample files come with 24 shifts types and sample data for each type. Blank values mean it's not needed for the particular shift type.

Please read the xMatters API documentation for Shift Object to understand what values can be put in this file.

## Misccellaneous

Some miscellaneous information.

### Variables

{{value}} indicates a reference to a collection or environment variable in Postman be careful when changing these. It is advised to change the variable value not the reference. You can only set Collection Variables as instructed [here](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/collections/data_formats#exporting-and-importing-postman-data).

Environment variables need to be set from the Pre-Request or Test section of Postman.

### Tests

All requests, no matter the format, set environment variables in the Tests tab of Postman.

### Typical Data File Error

When editing a data file with Excel you must save the file as a csv. Excel sometimes formats this poorly and adds an extra line at the end.
This will result in the last item in your data file failing.
Usually you will see a "/r" at the end of your last data parameter. This indicates an extra blank line was added to your csv file and it will cause a problem.

To resolve this just open the csv file in a text editor and remove the last blank line and save.
